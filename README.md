# 8-Bit MIPS ALU and Register File Project  
Seth Iris Canonigo, Connor Prior, Nahom Solomon, and Tedla Boke

This final project for CMPE 480 implements an 8-bit MIPS ALU and an 8-register file (including a zero register) using **Magic** for manual VLSI layout and **IRSIM** for digital simulation. It demonstrates fundamental processor operations, including arithmetic, logic, and data storage, entirely at the transistor level.
