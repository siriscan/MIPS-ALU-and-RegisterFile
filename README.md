# MIPS-ALU-and-RegisterFile
This project implements an 8-bit MIPS ALU and an 8-register file (including a zero register) using Magic for manual layout and IRSIM for digital simulation. It demonstrates fundamental processor operations, including arithmetic, logic, and data storage, entirely at the transistor level.
